Yet Another TVC Emulator

The Videoton TV Computer (TVC) is a retro computer produced by Videoton in Hungary in the eighties. it is based on a Zilog Z80 CPU, 32/64k RAM and 6845 CRTC. It has various expansion possibilities via Cartridge or Expansion slot.

There are many emulators for this computer but I wanted an open source emulator and I was also wondering if C#, WPF is powerful enough to write a full emulator. I also thought it important to emulate the computer's expansion capability at the emulator software level, using DLLs to emulate each expansion.

The emulator is still at the developement stage, the debugger is very basic and some features (pl. sound emulation) is not accurate. 

Here is the screenshot of the emulator:
